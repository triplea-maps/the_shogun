* TripleA Sounds
 * How it works: <br>
 * <b>Sound.Default.Folder</b>=ww2 <br>
 * This is the "key" that tells the engine which sound folder to use as the DEFAULT sound folder.
 * <br>
 * The default folders are as follows: <br>
 * "<b>ww2</b>" (which should cover ww1 - ww2 - ww3 sounds), <br>
 * "<b>preindustrial</b>" (anything from muskets/cannons (1500) to right before ww1 (1900), <br>
 * "<b>classical</b>" (the ancient era, anything before cannons became a mainstay (10,000 bce - 1500
 * ad) <br>
 * "<b>future</b>" (sci-fi, spaceships, lasers, etc) <br>
 * <br>
 * After this, you can specify specific sounds if you want, using the "sound key location" (aka:
 * sound map folder). <br>
 * The sound key location is the exact folder name for a sound you want, located under the "generic"
 * folder. What I mean by this is that all sound key locations that triplea supports, are the names
 * of all the folders in the "assets/sounds/generic/" folder. <br>
 * example: <br>
 * <b>battle_aa_miss</b>=ww2/battle_aa_miss;future/battle_aa_miss/battle_aa_miss_01_ufo_flyby.mp3
 * <br>
 * "battle_aa_miss" is one of the folders under "generic", therefore it is a "sound location key"
 * <br>
 * We can set this equal to any list of sounds paths, each separated by a semicolon (;). The engine
 * will pick one at random each time we need to play this sound. <br>
 * The "sound path" can be a "folder" or a "file". If it is a folder, we will use all the sounds in
 * that folder. If it is a file, we will only use that file. We can use a file and folder and
 * another file and another folder, all together. <br>
 * Example: "<b>ww2/battle_aa_miss</b>" is the sound path for a folder, so we will use all the
 * sounds in that folder. "<b>future/battle_aa_miss/battle_aa_miss_01_ufo_flyby.mp3</b>" is a
 * specific file, so we will use just this file. Because we use both of these together, the engine
 * will make a list of all the files in that folder, plus that single file we specified, then it
 * will randomly pick one of this whole list every time it needs to play the "battle_aa_miss" sound.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * So, lets say that you want to play 2 sounds, for the "battle_land" sound key. One of them is
 * located at "tripleainstallfolder/assets/sounds/generic/battle_land_01_angry_drumming_noise.mp3".
 * The other is located at
 * "tripleainstallfolder/assets/sounds/classical/battle_land_02_war_trumpets.mp3". Then the entry
 * would look like this: <br>
 * battle_land=
 * generic/battle_land_01_angry_drumming_noise.mp3;classical/battle_land_02_war_trumpets.mp3 <br>
 * If you wanted it to also play every single sound in the
 * "tripleainstallfolder/assets/sounds/ww2/battle_land/" folder, then you would add that folder to
 * path: <br>
 * battle_land= generic/battle_land_01_angry_drumming_noise.mp3;
 * classical/battle_land_02_war_trumpets.mp3;ww2/battle_land <br>
 * <br>
 * Furthermore, we can customize the sound key by adding "_nationName" onto the end of it. So if you
 * want a specific sound for a german land attack, then use: <br>
 * battle_land<b>_Germans</b>=misc/battle_land/battle_land_Germans_panzers_and_yelling_in_german.mp3
 * <br>
 * You can use nation specific sound keys for almost all sounds, though things like game_start, or
 * chat_message, will never use them. <br>
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>You do not need to specify every single "sound key". This is why/because we have the
 * "Sound.Default.Folder".</b> <br>
 * <br>
 * The logic is as follows: <br>
 * Engine needs to play the "game_start" sound. <br>
 * 1. Check for a sound.properties file. <br>
 * 2. If none exists, pretend that one exists and that it only contains this line:
 * "Sound.Default.Folder=ww2" <br>
 * 3. Look in the sound.properties file for the specific sound key "game_start" <br>
 * 4. Create a list of all sounds that the key includes. If no key, then just use all the sounds in
 * "Sound.Default.Folder/sound_key/" (which for us would be "ww2/game_start/" folder). <br>
 * 5. If no sounds are found, then use all the sounds located at "generic/sound_key/" (which for us
 * would be "generic/game_start"). (if any sounds are found in step 4 above, then we ignore the
 * generic folder completely) <br>
 * 6. Randomize the list's order, then pick one, and play the sound.
